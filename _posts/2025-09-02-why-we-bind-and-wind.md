**Thesis:** If you treat Meyer’s rapier rules (Rostock) as general rules of his art—not just rapier quirks—then *control via the bind* becomes the default from which good fencing flows. Hence our emphasis on **binding and winding**.

### 1) The “sword as source” and reading rules upward
Meyer (1570) says the **sword** is the “origin and source” of all other combat. He’s talking longsword, sure, but I read that as: other weapons inherit ideas from the sword. So if a principle is called out explicitly in the rapier rules, it likely exists—at least in spirit—in the longsword too. I’m not claiming perfect equivalence; I’m arguing for a helpful reading frame.

### 2) Treat the rules as axioms—before techniques
I take the rapier rules as **a priori** constraints: they govern what *counts* as good fencing before we pick a technique or tactic in the *Krieg*. That moves “bind and wind” from a trick to a **foundation**.

### 3) Rule 1 — Keep control
> Conduct your cuts and thrusts so you don’t lose control of your weapon or over-commit.

Basic? Yes. But most of us fence looser with feders than we would with sharps. I think Meyer knew this (hence the play-focused material vs. the more combative material). Control is the first gate we pass through.

### 4) Rule 2 — Don’t hit the body until you’re secure
> Don’t cut to the body until you’ve made yourself **secure with parrying**, and can **recover** safely.

I read “secure with parrying” as **establish a bind** (however brief): when swords touch, you can **Fühlen** (feel), locate strength/weakness, and **wind** to an open, safe line. This is why we drill winding like fiends.  
**Caveat:** I wouldn’t say *never* strike without a prior bind—Meyer also shows initiating actions that *bring your cover with the blow*. But as a **default**, “control the other blade first” is the safer, more general rule.

### 5) Rule 3 — Only bind on purpose
> Don’t let him touch/bind your blade unless you mean to **take** it; when the blades bind, you must have an opening, or your art is false.

So: don’t drift into meaningless binds. Bind **with intent**: to win the line, to wind, to displace and enter. Winding for the sake of winding is as empty as point-chasing without cover.

### 6) Rule 4 — Chasing and footwork
> Watch the limbs; when he gathers them, you have an opportunity for **chasing**. Step correctly and change around his hilt.

“Chasing” is nasty-good **from a bind**: with Fühlen and forward stepping, Nachreisen (traveling after) becomes simple, effective, and *safe*.

### 7) Rule 5 — How to *get* the bind (and keep it)
Pommel low by the leg, point up; **go through**; if he seeks your blade:
- Falls on the **foible** → **strike around** his blade;
- Falls on the **forte** → **jerk** (wrench) it to the other side;
- Finds the **middle** → **let it run**, fall back with **suppressing**, work immediately to the opening.

This is essentially a **playbook for entering and improving binds**. Deceptions aren’t for avoiding the blade entirely; they’re for luring the opponent into **bad binds** you can dominate.

### So why we bind and wind
Because it satisfies Rule 1 (your control) and Rule 2 (their control), and it lines up with Rules 3–5: bind on purpose, read with Fühlen, wind to take the line, then finish with recovery baked in. Feints and flourishes still have their place—but as tools to *create* or *exploit* binds, not to gamble on naked entries.

*If you disagree with my “read the rapier rules upward” approach, please yell at me gently. I’m happy to sharpen this.*
