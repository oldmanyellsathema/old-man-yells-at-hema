Feast your eyes on “The Best Fencer.”

I know this seems silly, but I’ve always had a problem with how we score fencers with wins and losses. I’ve seen people skate through and win a tournament with 8 fewer touches for than against, and I’ve seen people absolutely annihilate every fencer and then get knocked out on one bad call. One guy had 40 touches for and 8 against, and still got sent home. Was that person me? Maybe. Should I have lost that match? Yeah, probably. Am I exaggerating? I don’t know—it was years ago. So what can we do to fix this issue? Easy. Let’s change how we look at a tournament.

How do you score? I don’t know. Do whatever you want. Keep whatever scoring system you like.

How do you win a bout? You don’t.  
You fence for a time limit (some trial and error here).  
Everyone fences everyone, like a typical pool.  
Your tally of points scored throughout the pools is saved—both touches for and touches against.

- The fencer with the most touches (or points) for moves on.  
- The fencer with the fewest touches (or points) against moves on.  

Elims aren’t brackets. They’re another round robin. And there will be as many as needed for however many pools there are.

The fencer with the best **net differential** (touches for minus touches against) is the overall winner.  
Silver goes to two people: the best offensive fencer and the best defensive fencer.
