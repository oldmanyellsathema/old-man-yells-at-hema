Feast your eyes on **“The Best Fencer.”**

I know this seems silly, but I’ve always had a problem with how we score fencers by wins and losses. I’ve seen people skate through and win a tournament with 8 fewer touches *for* than *against*, and I’ve seen people absolutely annihilate every fencer, then get knocked out on one bad call. I’ve seen someone put up 40 touches for and only 8 against and still get eliminated. Was that person me? Maybe. Should I have lost that match? Yeah, probably. Am I exaggerating? I don’t know — it was years ago.  

So what can we do to fix this issue? Easy: let’s change how we look at a tournament.

### How do you score?  
I don’t know. Do whatever you want. Keep whatever scoring system you like.  

### How do you win a bout?  
You don’t.  

- You fence for a set **time limit** (some trial and error here).  
- Everyone fences everyone, like a typical pool.  
- Your tally of points scored throughout the pools is saved — both touches for and against.  

**Advancement rules:**  
- The fencer with the **most touches (points for)** moves on.  
- The fencer with the **fewest touches (points against)** moves on.  

**Elims:**  
- Eliminations aren’t brackets. They’re another pool.  
- There will be as many pools as needed, depending on turnout.  

**Winner:**  
- The fencer with the best **net differential** (touches for minus touches against) is the overall winner.  
- **Silver** goes to two people: the best offensive fencer and the best defensive fencer (or second best in either case, depending on the totals).
