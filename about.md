  <h2>About This Project</h2>
   <p>
    This space is pretty simple: it’s where I dump thoughts about HEMA, fencing, 
    and whatever else rattles around my head. A lot of it will be me, but not all— 
    other people’s ideas, rants, and links might wander in too.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Don’t expect a straight line. One week it might be a rant about tournament rules, 
    the next a book review, the next a drawing because I felt like it. 
    Sometimes I’ll talk gear, sometimes training, but mostly it will be nothing at all,
    I’m not exactly consistent. Think of it as a salon with a low bar to entry: 
    bring your opinion, sharpen it a bit, and throw it in the ring.  
  </p>

    At the end of the day, it’s my space. I do art, I fence, I ramble. 
    If you’re here, you’re probably the same kind of nerd. Welcome, but remember at the end of the day you have to Prove it with Iron.
