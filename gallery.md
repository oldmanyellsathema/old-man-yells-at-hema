    This is where I drop images—some end up here, some end up on Instagram. 
    They don’t always overlap, so if you actually care you might want to check both.

    Is all this art “great”? …no. Is it good? Maybe. Is it odd? Also maybe.  
    Look, art is the one spot where it’s not about what I think—it’s about what you do with it. 
    You can take it or leave it. Actually, don’t take it. It’s mine. But you can look.
